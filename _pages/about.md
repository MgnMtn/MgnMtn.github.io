Hi there! I am Megan, a **final-year PhD Student** in the [AI x Software Engineering and Testing (ASET) group](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cs/research/groups/testing) at the University of Sheffield, supervised by [Phil McMinn](https://philmcminn.com/) and [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/).

My research aims to improve **software testing** by **identifying weak oracles** in unit tests.
My recent work studies **pseudo-tested statements**, which are statements that a test case executes, yet even if the statement is removed, the test cases continue to pass.
These areas highlight gaps in the test suites to developers, such as **missing assertions** and test cases.

Alongside my research, I work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the **Software Testing and Analysis** module, where I support students in understanding and applying key concepts.

When I am not at the university, I enjoy volunteering with [Girlguiding UK](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/) to run camps and events for young people.
