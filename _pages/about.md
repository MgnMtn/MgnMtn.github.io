Hi there! I am Megan, a **final-year PhD Student** in the [AI x Software Engineering and Testing (ASET) group](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cs/research/groups/testing) at the University of Sheffield, supervised by [Phil McMinn](https://philmcminn.com/) and [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/).

My research focuses on improving **software testing** by **identifying weak oracles** in unit tests. 
I explore **pseudo-tested statements** that are executed by test cases, yet can be deleted without causing any test failures. 
These areas highlight gaps in the test suites to developers, such as **missing assertions** and test cases.

Alongside my research, I work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in **Software Testing and Analysis** where I support students in understanding and applying key concepts.

When I am not in the university, I enjoy volunteering with [Girlguiding UK](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/) to run camps and events for young people.
